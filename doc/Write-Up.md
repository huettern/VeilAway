# Trainline Write-Up

## Problem statement
Imagine yourselves sitting in a cozy seat of the scenic world-heritage railway track of the Rhaetian Railway, driving over the iconic Landwasserviaduct. You sip a cup of hot tea while it is raining cats and dogs, so much you can't really spot the beautiful landmarks. What is for you a bad coincidence can be daily business for railway drivers. They can't see the track side safety elements such as signals and signs. Reducing the reaction time of the driver, bad weather can have fatal consequences, if no precautions are taken. 

## Proposed solution
Reducing the speed of travel doesn't come at the desired consumer satisfaction. This is where we present **Trainline**, an augmented reality assistant to the train driver. By showing nice-weather pictures with overlaid information of the next signals, the train driver can make well-informed decision about accelerating or decelerating the vehicle.

## About us
Using data provided by Siemens, our team extracted Geo data and images and augmented them with rail track information. GPS navigation syncs the information to the current position of the train so that the train driver is always aware of its surroundings.

## Wrap up
**Trainline** improves the safety of railways during bad weather conditions while maintaining high service reliability. This is why we think **Trainline** belongs into each train drivers' cockpit.
